# Machine-learning-for-lithostratigraphy
Feasibility study of machine learning on lithostratigraphy based on well-logs from Troll oil field in Norway. 
Four types was tested for the purpose:
  1. Use (Easting, Northing, Depth) in ML
  2. Use 5 physical features and Depth in ML
  3. Use 5 physical features and (Easting, Northing, Depth) in ML
  4. Use 5 physical features only. This is known as rock facies classification.

The results are good, as shown in the PDF file, especially the test using 5 physical features and (Easting, Northing, Depth) in ML
More detailed studies will follow.
